# Linkedin-Scraping-Selenium
Scraping Linkedin using Selenium

This project includes following things:

- Used Selenium to scrape heavy JavaScript loaded Linkedin site.
- Used ChromeDriver as web driver.
- Linkedin logging in and then scraping a list of profiles using google query.
- Scraped Name, Job Title, Company, Location and exported the data to csv file.
- Also added facility to connect and add these profiles to personal Linkedin network.
- As Linkedin has strict policies for scraping, so have created a safe script with proper time interval sleeps in between.
